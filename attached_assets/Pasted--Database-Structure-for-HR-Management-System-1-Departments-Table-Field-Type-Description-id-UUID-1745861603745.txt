üìä Notes for AI
Use foreign keys to ensure relationships between employees, departments, and functions.

Add indexes for fast search by employee name, status, license expiration dates.

All dates should be stored in UTC format for consistency.

The system must support soft delete (archive instead of hard delete) for employee records.
